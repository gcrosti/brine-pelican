# brine-pelican

I'm using Pelican.py to generate static HTML pages of dishes users create on Brine. Links to pages will then power a share link feature in the app.

Brine helps you remember and share the dishes you love.

Check out Brine's repository at https://github.com/gcrosti/Brine

The Brine Android app is built entirely in Kotlin. It is a single activity app that utilises modern architecture components such as Room, ViewModel, LiveData, and Data Binding.

I am looking for collaborators. To contribute to this project, contact me@giuseppecrosti.com
